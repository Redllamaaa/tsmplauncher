## Installation Guide
Installation is fairly straightforward. If you need assistance, you can follow the brief instructions below.

### Windows

* Download and run the Windows version of the launcher (`.exe`).
* Windows SmartScreen will open.
* This is not a virus. To have it signed and have this not show up costs real money. I am not doing that. Deal with it.
